# Team Sprint Summaries

## Milestone 0: Requirements

#### Team Meetings

During the Requirement Phase for this project every team member participated in most team meetings, because during the first meeting for the phase it was problematic to find the right times to meet up with the team due to scheduling conflicts. But, as we moved along the phase we still found time to meet up and discuss what to do. As a team we split up the requirements doc into different section and everyone chooses the assignments that we listed in discord. As a team we used discord to communicate between team members assignments and organized different channels to discuss different topics about this phase. We also had scrum meeting in the discord channel named "Scrum" to discussed daily updates on assigned assignments.

#### Requirements Assignments

For this assignments we split up the work as followed

- Use Cases
- User Stories
- Nonfunctional Requirements
- Business Requirements
- User Requirements
- Formatting/Wording

We created a discord channel named "Backlogs" and during a team meeting we had listed assignments needed for the Requirement doc and then after we listed everything we needed everyone choose the assignments listed above to work on.

##### Use Cases:

This assignment was to create use cases diagrams for visual purposes.

##### User Stories:

This assignment was to create use cases on how the customer, manager, and drone owner would be using this program.

##### Nonfunctional Requirements:

This assignment is to list out all the Nonfunctional Requirements

##### Business Requirements:

This assignment is to list out all the Business Requirements

##### User Requirements:

This assignment is to list out all the User Requirements

##### Functional Requirements:

This assignment is to list out all the Functional Requirements

##### Formatting/Wording:

This assignment is to grab all the docs and format it to one doc

#### Summary

In summary, everyone went through a final check with the doc and we all say submit to enter the last doc for grading. All in all, everyone did their part in this sprint.

## Milestone 1: Design

### Team Dynamic

During this sprint we were able to meet and work frequently as a team particularly in the first week during the high level design portion. We were able to make use of digital means to be able to meet when people were unable to attend in person. Completing the high level design phase went pretty smoothly and we all seemed fairly confident on what we needed to do. The second week of the sprint was a little more rough. Schedules became more busy and made finding a common meeting time a lot more difficult. We decided to implement your suggestion of having two different groups working on similar things to meet at two different times and then coordinate together. It took some getting used to but eventually we were able to get it all figured out and were able to sort out who was doing what. There were times where getting a hold of everyone was a little difficult as well, we each have very different schedules. But in the end everyone got their work done and pulled their weight.

Scrum meetings in class where super helpful. It provided a time for use throughout the week to all meet for a few minutes and get coordinated which allowed us to stay productive throughout the week even when it was hard to meet at other times. It will be helpful in future sprints for the time in class to meet together because all of us have that time set aside already and are almost all always coming to class.

### Workload Division

The way that we divided the work up was back end and front end portions of the system. Two people worked on writing the design for the back end and three worked on the front end (these are the two groups that could meet at different times). Here are a summary of the different tasks:

- UML design
- endpoints between front end and backend
- learning Django
- learning Svelte
- Creating wireframe prototypes
- psuedo code for each screen

# Milestone 2: Development - Sprint 2

We divided the work by having a front end team and a back-end team. Each team would divide work as they saw fit. I am on front-end team and we each chose some pages to work on and would do those pages. We were just focusing on getting the html and css done so we can have just the basics done so later we can get the javascript done so the dynamic elements can be easily added. This was to get the basics done and make it easy to focus on just javascript on its own. Back-end we got the migration, api token verification, and models done.

# Milestone 2: Development - Sprint 3

This week, our team was supposed to finish large portions of the project, as this is the middle of three development sprints.

### Objectives

The frontend team was assigned to complete the login pages with working reactive elements on the frontend and making api calls when neccecary. Cart page and order pages to be complete.

The backend team was assigned to complete the database models and add api endpoints for adding a new drone, getting inventory status, adding an order, and get finances.

### Successes

The frontend team saw little success in either merge requests or written updates in the discord server.

The backend team saw the completion of the database models and the addition of GET and POST address endpoints and GET inventory endpoint.

### Drawbacks

Aaron on the frontend was having trouble getting a CORS error resolved last week. Help was offered and declined. I am still waiting on his update to me.

Taryn is having personal health events and was able to put forward a few skeletons of a couple api endpoints.

Jakob is reporting a family emergency and will need an extra day to get login pages completed.

I am stil waiting on Alex's update to me.

# Milestone 2: Development - Sprint 4

This week, the goal was to finish development. Although we did not quite get to that point, we got quite a bit done.

We also wanted to figure out how to fix our CORS errors.

### Objectives

The frontend team was assigned to finish the log-in pages (left over from previous sprint) finish creating drone pages and drone user things, create manager pages, and create user account pages.

The backend team was assigned to create some new endpoints, such as ordering a cone, seeing past orders, "customer support" endpoing (to message manager from customer) and endpoints to view and add drones to a drone users acocunt.

We also wanted to add in some migrations to make testing and using the servers easier.

### Successes

The frontend team saw quite a bit of success in making progress in their objectives. Most everything has been finished including log-ins, drone managment pages, manager pages, and some account pages.

The backend team saw the completion of the endpoints being created, and added a migration for drone users to automatically exist in the data base.

### Drawbacks

Fixing the cors errors took a while to figure out, and until it was fixed, stopped us from making good communications between the frontend and the backend.

I (Jakob) got very sick and was unable to contribute as much as I'd hoped, however the rest of the team picked up the slack and made good progress despite this.

# Milestone 3: Deployment

In this last team sprint for testing and deployment it ended in a complicated mess. As the leader, I tried to have more meetings than we did than the last sprints. In total, we meet up 5 times. Three times in person and two times over discord chats. We ended up finish up implementation and only left the last week of this sprint as testing. In one of the meetings, we had a two hour meeting for testing and we were going over the specific accounts we had for this website. In which it included, the manager page, drone page, and customer/order page. Although, when we started testing we meet couple bugs in our program. At the end of the meeting we designated people in our group to fix certain bugs. Paul, had a the major management over the backend with the help of Taryn, Aaron work on the customer account page and the drone page. Jacob work on the sign-in page for the manager, drone, and customer page. Alex work on the order page, the css design of the website, the manager page, and the front page of the website. Everyone had their assign part in the website and had expected major focus on what they had to work on. All in all, we started great with the beginning sprints and at the end it fell apart, because of time scheduling conflicts that made it difficult to meet and life situation we couldn't control. In all of the meetings we had, we didn't have 100% of all members in the team meetings , in which made even difficult to communicate with everyone on specific bugs/tasks that need to be worked on.
